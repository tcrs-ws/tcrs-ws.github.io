## Submissions
TCRS '25 will work with [IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL)](https://ieee-ceda.org/publication/esl) for paper submissions, reviews, and publication.
Submissions meeting IEEE ESL requirements will be published in the special issue of TCRS in IEEE ESL.
All submissions must be written in English. 
Only original papers that have not been submitted or published in other conferences or journals will be considered.

### Submission Guidelines
Papers submitted to TCRS '25 must follow the [IEEE ESL Paper Submission Instructions](https://ieee-ceda.org/publication/esl/esl-paper-submission).
Submitted manuscripts must be **four pages or fewer**, including all figures, tables, and references.
Submissions exceeding this length will be returned without review. Papers should use 7.875 in x 10.75 in (20 cm x 27.30 cm) trim size and the IEEE transactions two-column format in 10-pt. font.
The review process is **blind** (not double-blind);
please do not submit anonymized manuscripts.

### Submission Instructions
Submissions will be managed through the [IEEE Author Portal for IEEE ESL](https://ieee.atyponrex.com/journal/les-ieee). 

Once you are signed in to the IEEE Author Portal, click on "Start submission" at the top right.
Then, click on Article Type" under the "Your Progress" menu on the right.
On the next page, choose "TCRS 2025" under the dropdown menu.
After confirming the check boxes, you will be prompted to upload your manuscript.

### Conflicts of Interest Requirements
In addition to the manuscript, the authors are required to submit a document for **Conflict of Interest (COI)** with the program committee members through the IEEE Author Portal.
The authors are required to submit the COI document during the submission process.

### Acceptance Tiers
At least one of the authors for each paper must fully register and present the accepted paper at the workshop.
TCRS '25 will have two tiers of final acceptance.

1. *Present-only* acceptance.
2. *Present-and-publish* acceptance.

The *Present-only* tier acceptance will be given to the submissions that meet the TCRS workshop quality requirements.
The *Present-and-publish* tier acceptance will be given to the submissions that are accepted for presentation at the TCRS workshop _and_ considered for publication in the IEEE ESL journal.

All papers with any of these two tiers of acceptance will be presented at the workshop and distributed as proceedings of the workshop.
However, only the papers with the *Present-and-publish* tier acceptance will be published in the IEEE ESL special issue of TCRS.

### Review Process
Authors of the submissions will be notified with the first round of reviews.
Below are the subsequent processes for accepted papers.

#### 1. *Present-only* acceptance
Papers that are not accepted for publication in the IEEE ESL journal may still be eligible to present at the workshop.
In this case, the authors will receive a "reject" from IEEE ESL and a separate "Present-only" acceptance notification from TCRS.
Authors of a submission with *Present-only* acceptance will be asked to submit the final version of their paper, which will be included in the "*proceedings to be distributed*."

#### 2. *Present-and-publish* acceptance
Authors of a submission with *Present-and-publish* acceptance will receive a "minor revision" decision from the IEEE ESL journal.
The authors will be required to submit a revised version of their paper and a video graphical abstract (which is a short video presenting the paper), which will be reviewed in the second round.
Once the final manuscript and the video graphical abstract are reviewed and meet IEEE ESL standards, the submission will receive an "accept" decision from the journal and will be included in the IEEE ESL special issue of TCRS.

See [here](https://ieee-ceda.org/publication/esl/esl-paper-submission) for more information on the video graphical abstract.
